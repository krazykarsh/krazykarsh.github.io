This all might sound repetitive, I myself am quite tired of telling same story multiple times. IDK why I do that, and maybe this feels a bit selfish to me everytime I do that, Even in june I shouldn't have just told you about my feelings and kept it to me, that wouldn't have ruined your mood. I just came out of nowhere and made you visit the old bad times. Anyway sorry for that, In our relationship I only remember telling you 2 lies, one I told you about in the last mail and this one is a bit silly one when at the start you asked who knows about us and I said just ankur. Well in a way karan and simranjeet also knew about my crush towards you, thanks to simranjeet that's how I had so many pictures of you without even asking them from you, maybe a bit creepy I guess. Anyway yeah that's it this was the other thing out of the 2. And that night when you cried it made me feel like my mail came out as manipulative that made you feel that way, I am sorry for that. I do feel that sometimes I just stupidly act like a victim idk why though. Baaki this will remain true forever no matter where you are in the world or no matter how many years have passed, I will love you no matter what. 25th september ko when we were on video call discussing about things, you know I told things about that kind of I took personally on myself ki why am I not good enough to do one good thing, in this relationship. In the past july-sept waale months I couldn't detach myself from you so alag se sochna pd rha tha, anyway yeah that was just my senstivity for everything to take things personally. And in a way that's true I can't even remember one good thing I did in that relationship, while you did so many favours/things. Coming to this oct waala time, I would have loved to live/spend my time with you, Harikesh waali baat batane k baad it felt like I didn't put my words right, the only 1 thing that was bothering me was "sex" and I didn't even write that in my msgs while I wrote about dates and all that. Baaki yes in a way it will hurt me, not from your perspective though. To me it looks like you lost your main support in that time, he became your support and you felt attracted to him and that made things happen. But from his perspective, I can't take it in a way as I thought him to be my friends and I won't say much about it but it does feels weird. Oo and you called me recently but when I called back I didn't connect for some reason, I know about your haircut though it does looks nice. Yukti shared me a photo of yours, it looks cute, but I told her to not to send me those pics anymore coz BT hoti h phir. IDK why am I sending this to you though. Probably these are some leftovers things that I wanted to tell you at max. And yes this is true aise easily nai jaega and I am kind of breaking the no contact again. People say that there's no point in telling your things and fixing them, uss mail k baad or bura lga ki kyu hi bheja maine, itne time se nai bataya tha or nai batate. Uss time nothing was going right in my life, at least it felt that way. Job well I was juggling in 2 jobs, at pay of 1. Kaash thoda pay hi high hota to at least single room afford krke I would have asked you to move in, but anyway khwabo mein nai jeena hota reality is different. Uss time as such amazing connection to nai tha kisi friend k saath but jo 1 person I was connected with most, uske saath bhi nothing was going right, fights and all mein end up hota ja rha tha. And then the place where I live in, roommate k saath rehne k baad vo peace to chala jata h but bed bugs took the place that I literally paid for. And pata nai mujhe effort nai lg rhe the to do things, everything just going down down and down. To I decided to leave bangalore, I didn't want to leave you. But things just weren't right. Na tumahra saath bahar ja pata kahi, vo to chhodo facetime tk pr to aata nai tha, just cause I wasn't feeling like it. I can't actually make you understand it. But hopefully in a way you do believe ki jyada harm na kia ho maine, idk kitna kra hoga and all. And I am not good with words, ye msg kisi friend ko bataya to definitely gaalian denge mujhe vo ki I contacted you again. But the point of this msg is to get the things out of me and tell you in a way, pehle to letter type bhejne wala tha but then felt like too risky ghar waale and all. And you know I did feel ki mai bhi tumahri jyada help nai kr paya, delhi mein gharwaale the and bangalore mein female PG, tbhi ye naman ka dekhkr mera single room ka or mann tha ki same jagah pr hoge to problems shakal pr dikh jaengi and help krne ka try to kroge hi but then how things ended up was just bad. Geez I drove away from the point again, yeah coming back to it was just about telling you that I had always loved you, I will always love you. Goodbye, take care of yourself and probably find a healthy person to live with. I won't contact you again as that's what you want and that way you can heal in your own way. And I guess that's what right too, only be someone if they wants to be with you. Anyway Goodbye and block me from hangout as well, though I will try not to contact you there as well, sorry been trying to keep myself from contacting you, weekends are the worst.
